        <h2 style="text_align: left">What is Self defence?</h2>
        <p>
Self-defense is the legal use of reasonable force to protect oneself or others from imminent harm. Rooted in the belief that individuals have the inherent right to
 safeguard their lives, self-defense requires that the response be proportional to the immediate threat, and reasonable efforts to avoid the need for force should be made. 
 Legal criteria typically include the principles of imminence, proportionality, avoidance, and reasonableness. While the concept is universal, the specific laws governing 
 self-defense can vary by jurisdiction,\and understanding the legal framework is crucial for individuals navigating potential situations where self-defense may be invoked as a 
 justifiable response.</p>

      <h2 style="text_align: left">Why is Self defence important?</h2>
        <p>
        Self-defense is essential for personal safety, empowerment, and societal well-being. It equips individuals with the tools to protect themselves, 
        fostering confidence and a proactive mindset, while also acting as a deterrent against crime. Its comprehensive nature includes heightened situational awareness and 
        contributes to both physical and mental fitness. In essence, self-defense is a holistic approach to safety, offering empowerment, prevention of victimization, and the 
        cultivation of independence.</p>

      <h2 style="text_align: left">How to use self defence</h2>
        <p>
        Self-defense, including martial arts, combines mastering physical techniques, mental preparedness, and situational awareness. Training instills foundational moves, 
        emphasizes alertness, and encourages de-escalation. Using force is a last resort, aiming to neutralize threats. Confidence, mental readiness, and all types of awareness are 
        key, with ongoing learning for current strategies. Effective self-defense prioritizes personal safety, non-violent resolutions, and judicious use of force.</p>
